Feature: Manage repeatable reference dictionaries
  In order to resolve repeatable field codes into labels
  As an admin
  I need to create reference domains and import code-label pairs

  Scenario: Create a reference domain
    Given I log in as "admin"
    When I navigate to "Plugins > Local plugins > Manage repeatable reference dictionaries" in site administration
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I set the field "Domain shortname" in the "Create or update domain" "fieldset" to "iso639"
    And I set the field "Domain name" to "Languages"
    And I press "Create or update domain"
    Then I should see "Domain saved: iso639"
    And I should see "Languages"

  Scenario: Reject an invalid domain shortname
    Given I log in as "admin"
    When I navigate to "Plugins > Local plugins > Manage repeatable reference dictionaries" in site administration
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I set the field "Domain shortname" in the "Create or update domain" "fieldset" to "Bad Domain!"
    And I press "Create or update domain"
    Then I should see "Invalid domain shortname. Use lowercase letters, numbers, and underscore only."

  Scenario: Import reference items from pasted CSV
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Plugins > Local plugins > Manage repeatable reference dictionaries" in site administration
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I set the field "Domain shortname" in the "Create or update domain" "fieldset" to "iso639"
    And I press "Create or update domain"
    When I expand all fieldsets
    And I set the field "Domain shortname" in the "Import CSV" "fieldset" to "iso639"
    And I set the field "CSV content (optional)" to multiline:
      """
      code,label
      pt,Portuguese
      en,English
      """
    And I press "Import CSV"
    Then I should see "Import completed. Inserted: 2, Updated: 0, Ignored: 0."
